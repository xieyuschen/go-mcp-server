# Release Process

This repo contains the go-mcp-server implementation and its corresponding VS Code extension.
The VS Code extension is located in the `vscext` directory and go-mcp-server is located in the project root as the other go projects.

We will create different release tags for the go-mcp-server and the VS Code extension.

- go-mcp-server release tags will be in the format `vX.Y.Z`, e.g., `v0.1.0`, `v1.0.0`.
- VS Code extension release tags will be in the format `vscext@vX.Y.Z`, e.g., `vscext@v0.0.1`, `vscext@v1.0.0`.

To release a new version of the VS Code extension, you need to run `npm version <patch|minor|major>` in the `vscext` directory to update the version in `vscext/package.json` and then commit it. Then, create a git tag with the format `vscext@vX.Y.Z` corresponding to the new version
and push the tag to GitHub. This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow to build and publish the VS Code extension to the marketplace.

The changelogs are generated by filter all commit messages with certain prefixes.

- go-mcp-server: prefix `mcpgo` or `all`
- VS Code extension: prefix `vscext` or `all`

Hence, the commit message should follow the format
`<prefix>:<verb> <description>`, e.g., `mcpgo:fix bug in server`, `vscext:add new feature`.
